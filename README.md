# 5minstory
I really enjoy reading, but I have noticed that on weekdays it is very difficult to find even 10 minutes to read a book. So I decided to create a 5 min story. This is a website that randomly displays one of 99 short stories that the user can read in 5 minutes or less.
            
The website was built with fastAPI and uses AirTable as a database.
